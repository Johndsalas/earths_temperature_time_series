# Earth’s Average Temperature: A Time Series Analysis

In this project I will analyze and compare two time series representing Earth’s average monthly temperature. The first series contains only measurements that are taken on land, the second contains measurements that were taken on land and ocean. <br>

**My analysis will attempt to address the following questions:** <br>

1) Is Earth’s average temperature rising over time?

2) Does Earth’s average temperature fluctuate in a predictable pattern?

3) Can we use readings of past Earth temperatures to predict future Earth temperatures?

4) Does taking the Earth’s average temperature over land very significantly from its average temperature taken over land and ocean?

**This project will include:** <br>

1) a main notebook containing my analysis

2) The py files needed to run the notebook

The data has been provided by Kaggle, and is available at [this](https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data) address.
